#' @title Export, Import, or Delete Users and User Permissisons
#' 
#' @description These methods enable the user to add and remove users from
#'   a project. They also enable the user to modify the permissions 
#'   granted to each user within the project.

#' @inheritParams common-rcon-arg
#' @inheritParams common-dot-args
#' @inheritParams common-api-args
#' @param dates `logical(1)`. When `TRUE`, expiration dates are converted to a
#'   `POSIXct` object.
#' @param labels `logical(1)`. When `TRUE` the data export and form access rights are
#'   converted to factor objects.
#' @param form_rights `logical(1)`. When `TRUE`, the form rights will be 
#'   transformed to one column per form. The API-provided character string
#'   is always returned with the format `[form_name]:[access_code]` and a comma separating
#'   each form.
#' @param users `character`. Vector of unique user names to be deleted.
#' @param data `data.frame`. Provides the user data for import. It must have
#'   a column titled `username`. All other columns are optional.
#' @param consolidate `logical(1)`. When `TRUE`, the form and data 
#'   export access values will be read from the expanded columns. Otherwise, 
#'   the consolidated values (as provided by the API export) are utilized.
#' @param refresh `logical(1)`. When `TRUE`, the cached data will
#'   be refreshed after the API action is complete.

#'   User project access fields (those not related to forms or exports) 
#'   are mapped between coded and labeled values as:
#' 
#'   | Code | Label     |
#'   |------|-----------|
#'   | 0    | No Access |
#'   | 1    | Access    | 
#'   
#'   Form access fields are mapped as:
#'   
#'   | Code | Label                                                                 |

#'   | 1 | View records/responses and edit records (survey responses are read-only) |
#'   | 2 | Read Only                                                                |
#'   | 3 | Edit survey responses                                                    |

#'   Form export permission fields are mapped as:

#'   | Code | Label                          |
#'   |------|--------------------------------|
#'   | 0    | No Access                      |

#'   ## Importing Users/User Roles
#'   
#'   It is not required that the user provide a data frame with all of the 
#'   fields available for modification. Only fields that are provided will
#'   be modified. The only required field for imports is the `username` field.
#' 
#'   When setting permissions for a user project access fields, form access, 
#'   and form export permissions, the user may provided any of the coded 
#'   or labeled values above. The user data is passed through 
#'   [prepUserImportData()] before sending it to the API;  
#'   text values will be converted to the numeric value. 
#' 
#'   It is also permissible to use a column for each form individually, as can
#'   be exported via [exportUsers()]. With `consolidate = TRUE`, these 
#'   settings will be consolidated into the text string expected by the API. 
#' 
#'   The REDCap API does not natively allow for modifying the rights of a user
#'   that is part of a User Role. When an attempt to modify the rights of a 
#'   user in a User Role is made with this package, the user will be removed
#'   from the User Role, the rights modified, and then the User Role restored. 
#'   This is done silently: be aware that modifications to a user's rights 
#'   may not have an impact while the User Role is assigned.
#'   
#' ### Limitations 
#' 
#'   When importing via CSV, (as redcapAPI does by default) it appears that 
#'   the form access rights are imported but may not always be reflected in 
#'   the exported values. The form export rights do not appear to be imported
#'   when using the CSV format. We may be able to resolve this in the future
#'   using a JSON format.
