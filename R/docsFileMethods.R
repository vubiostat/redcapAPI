#' @title Export, Import, or Delete Files to a Field in a REDCap Project
#' 
#' @description These methods enable to the user to export a file stored
#'   in a project field, import a file, or delete an existing file. 
#'   
#' @inheritParams common-rcon-arg
#' @inheritParams common-dot-args
#' @inheritParams common-api-args
#' @param record `character(1)` or `integerish(1)`. The record ID in 
#'   which the desired file is stored. 
#' @param field `character(1)`. The field name in which the file is stored. 
#' @param event `character(1)` or `NULL`. The event name for the file.  
#'   This applies only to longitudinal projects.  If the event is not
#'   supplied for a longitudinal project, the API will return an error message
#' @param repeat_instance `integerish(1)` or `NULL`. The repeat instance number of 
#'   the repeating event or the repeating instrument. When available in your 
#'   instance of REDCap, and passed as `NULL`, the API will assume a value of 1.
#' @param file `character(1)`. The file path to the file to be imported.
#' @param overwrite `logical(1)`.  When `FALSE`, the function checks 
#'   if a file already exists for that record.  If a file exists, the function 
#'   terminates to prevent overwriting.  When `TRUE`, no additional 
#'   check is performed.
#' @param dir `character(1)`. A directory/folder to which the file 
#'   will be saved. By default, the working directory is used.
#' @param file_prefix `logical(1)`.  Determines if a prefix is appended 
#'   to the file name.  The prefix takes the form `[record_id]-[event_name]-[file_name]`.  
#'   The file name is always the same name of the file as it exists in REDCap.
#'   
#' @details These functions only export, import, or delete a single file.
#' 
#' When exporting, the file cannot be changed; whatever name exists in 
#' REDCap is the name that will be used. The record ID and event name 
#' may be appended as a prefix.
#' 
#' @return 
#' `exportFiles` has no return and displays a message with file path to
#'   which the exported file was saved.
#'   
#' `importFiles` has no return and displays a message indicating whether
#'   the import was successful.
#'
#' `deleteFiles` has no return and displays a message indicating whether
#'   the file was successfully deleted from the project.
