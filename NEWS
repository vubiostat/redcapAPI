* New functions use pre-existing error handling strategy.

## 2.7.1

Version bump for CRAN publication

## Changes in Version 2.7.0

* The new function exportRecordsTyped is now available as a replacement for the existing exportRecords. It is a breaking change in interface--but provides
far better stability in calling--full inversion of control over casting, retries through the connection object, and a clear error report as part of the final dataframe. Please take a moment to read the documentation on exportRecordsTyped and start moving over to using it over exportRecords.
* bundle argument has been removed from all API methods. (It is no longer needed, thanks to caching). Backward compatibility is unaffected.
* Introduces the offlineConnection function, which creates the redcapOfflineConnection object. This connection object can be built using either data frames structured like those received from the API methods, or the CSV files downloaded from the REDCap UI. The object function in the same way as an API connection with caching. Meta data can be retrieved via rcon$metadata(), etc..
* added castForImport. Recasts a `data.frame` back into the expected text values.
* added exportReportsTyped. Similar to exportRecordsTyped. * Helper function exportBulkRecords for bulk calls to exportRecordsTyped.


## Changes in Version 2.6.2

* Added retry parameter to connection object. On timeouts and gateway failures it retries 5 times now by default.
* Cleanup from emergency patches.

## Changes in Version 2.6.1

* Emergency fix. REDCap latest version changed its API calling syntax.
* Fix to choice name parsing when only a single choice is specified.
* Fix to importMethod validators when event=NULL

## Changes in Version 2.6.0

* A set of functions to deal with file import / export in REDCap
  * exportFileRepositoryListing
  * exportFromFileRepository
  * exportFileRepository
  * importToFileRepository
  * deleteFromFileRepository
  * createFileRepositoryFolder
  * importFileRepository
  * deleteFileRepository

## Changes in Version 2.5.0

* IMPORTANT: The upcoming 3.0.0 release will be a breaking change for exportRecords. This is needed for full inversion of control to the user over type casting.
* Fully removed deprecated redcapDbConnection
* Added a drop= argument to exportRecords and exportReports. These columns are dropped before returning.
* Metadata is cached in the connection object. In addition to token, url, and config elements, the following are also made available:
   * metadata
   * arms
   * events
   * fieldnames
   * mapping
   * users
   * version
   * projectInformation
each of these has a companion function
   * has_* (returns a logical indicating if the element has been cached)
   * flush_* (removes the cached value)
   * refresh_* (replaces the cached value with a fresh call to the API)
There are also flush_all and refresh_all methods.
* New method: exportLogging
* Fixed minor bugs in validations and improved documentation
* Fixed bug in formatting vectors for API calls in multiple places #33
* Removed stringr and tidyr as dependencies
* Removed unused version argument from checkbox_suffix
* Fixed error thrown in export_users when labels=TRUE
* Greatly expanded test coverage
* mChoice class addition if Hmisc is installed

## Changes in Version 2.4.2

* Added a missingSummary function that deals with branching logic.
* Fixed bug in delete records.
* Fixed bug date handling for NA in date conversion of time_hh_mm_ss

## Changes in Version 2.4.0

* Added handlers overrides for type conversion based on REDCap field type.

## Change in Ownership 2.3.3

Transfer from Benjamin Nutter to VUMC Biostatistics. 

## Changes in Version 2.3
* Bug fix: Unmapped suffixes do not cause crashes, only warnings.

## Changes in Version 2.2
* BREAKING CHANGE: The `dev_allocate` and `prod_allocate` elements of the 
  object returned by `allocationTable` have been named `dev_allocation` and 
  `prod_allocation`, respectively.  
* Bug fix: `importRecords` now handles data with repeating forms correctly.
* New feature: UTF-8 Characters may be stripped from the data dictionary.

## Change up to Version 2.1 (2018-03-03)
* Bug fix: Add `[form]_complete` fields
* Bug fix: Include `[form]_complete` fields in Reports
* New feature: `[form]_complete` fields may be explicitly requested.
* New feature: Automatic selection of `[form]_complete` fields may be turned off.

## Changes in Version 2.0 (2017-01-18)
* redcapDbConnection methods are being deprecated.  To our knowledge, no one
  is using these methods, and we do not believe they would work as previously 
  coded anyway. The methods definitions continue to be reserved although 
  they will likely not be developed in the foreseeable future (if at all).
  Please file an issue on GitHub if you feel such methods would be of use.
* `redcapProjectInfo` is being deprecated, as it will inevitably create confusion
  with the API method `exportProjectInformation`.  The replacement function is
  `exportBundle`.
* export bundles are now placed into the option `redcap_bundle` by default.
  For now, exportBundle will also return that same object.  This is to prevent
  back-compatibility problems with existing code but will change at a future date.
* Added several new API functions.  All functions up to REDCap 6.5.0 are included.
* Optional arguments that previously had no default now default to NULL. There 
  should be no change in behavior related to this change.
* Further standardization to documentation.  Each function has three new sections: 
  "From the REDCap Documentation" which gives the description of the function as
  taken from the REDCap documentation; "REDCap Version" which gives the versions of
  REDCap for which the function is known to operate; and "Known REDCap Limitations"
  which documents any bugs or other limitations that may be encountered when working
  with the API
* the `fieldToVar` function now operates on a switch statement instead of a sequence
  of `if else` blocks.  It also incorporates a `for` loop in place of the 
  `lapply` and `<<-` structure.
* Error checking, when feasible, makes use of the `checkmate` package.
* `exportVersion` will now return "5.12.2" for all versions of REDCap less than 6.0.0.
  While it is admittedly odd, this allows for consistent logical comparisons of 
  of versions and allows better control of the package's behavior over multiple 
  versions of REDCap.
* REDCap variables that can reasonably be treated as factors are given an additional
  class, `redcapFactor`, that inherits whatever class the variable becomes on 
  export. For example, if `factors = TRUE`, the new class will be 
  `c("redcapFactor", "factor")`, otherwise, it may be something similar to 
  `c("redcapFactor", "numeric")`.  This is done to assist in converting factors 
  back and forth between classes as needed (particular when using `redcapFactorFlip`).
* A package option is added for how to manage errors returned by the API.  This is
  used to assist in dealing with errors relating to bugs in the API and/or the user's
  version of REDCap.  For instance, if an API method doesn't exist for the user's 
  version of REDCap, the user can control if a hard error is returned, or if a 
  `NULL` value is returned. See `?redcap_error` for details.
* Codebase has been standardized and given a cleaner format (yeah, that's totally 
  subjective)

Changes in Version 1.3.5 (2017-01-20)
  * Bug fixes from @tobadia. (Issue #79)

Changes in Version 1.3.2 (2015-12-09)
  * Bug fix. Changed the call to fieldToVar in exportReports; was incorrectly referencing the meta_data field names. Thanks to Will Campbell for finding this bug.

Changes in Version 1.3.1 (2015-07-05)
  * Changed the default `config` argument in `redcapConnection` from `config=list()`
    to `config=httr::config()`.
  * Added code to allow all errors from `apiCall` to be returned correctly.

Changes in Version 1.3 (2015-03-04)
  * The Maintainer has been changed to Stephen Lane
  * Bug fix: The REDCap API Error message for `exportEvents`, `exportArms`, and 
    `exportMappings` changed between versions 5.x and 6.0.  In 5.x, the error 
    message is "You cannot export arms for classic projects." In 6.0+, it is
    "ERROR: You cannot export arms for classic projects."  The change causes 
    `exportEvents`, `exportArms`, and `exportMappings` to cast an error instead
    of returning the character string with the error.  The bug fix accommodates
    the error messages from both 5.x and 6.0+.

## Changes in Version 1.2 (2015-02-01)
  * Code has been rewritten to make use of the `roxygen2` documentation style.
  * The function 'allocationTable' is added.  This assists in producing
    allocation tables for the randomization module.
  * Offline versions for 'exportRecords' and 'allocationTable' are 
    included.  These produce output identical to the API calls, but 
    operate based on the csv's downloaded via the user interface.

## Changes in Version 1.1 (2014-10-01)
  * redcapAPI now depends on R 3.0.0 or higher
  * A bug fix was added.  When specifying the 'fields' and 'forms' arguments 
    in 'exportRecords', only the variables in 'fields' were being converted
    to the appropriate data types.  This has been corrected.
  * redcapAPI requires Hmisc 3.14-6 or higher.  This is a consequence of 
    the following item.  Please update your Hmisc package.
  * The Hmisc package was moved from the Suggests field to the Imports 
    field.  This reflects the addition of some of the label functions in 
    Hmisc being explicitly exported, making them available to import.  

## Changes in Version 1.0.1 (2014-10-20)
  * Bug fix: in `importRecords` meta data was not previously exported 
    when a project info object was not provided.  This is now corrected
  * Bug fix: in `exportRecords` and `exportReports`, the checkbox labels
    weren't being returned as factor levels when `checkboxLabels=TRUE`.
    The behavior is now consistent with expectations.
  * Bug fix: in `compareRedcapVersion`, a logical check was failing due 
    to an omitted argument in `grepl`.  This has been corrected.
  * added function `apiCall`.  This wraps a call to `tryCatch`.  If a 
    Gnu/TLS recv error is returned, the encoding is changed from 'gzip' 
    to 'identity' to successfully retrieve the API response.
  * `tryCatch` calls are added to `redcapProjectInfo` to prevent fatal 
    errors when one of the API functions casts an error.  The output 
    is modified to indicate where the problem occurred.  This is most 
    likely to affect `exportUsers`. An unresolved issue behind this is 
    logged in the issues on GitHub.
