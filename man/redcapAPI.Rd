REDCap is a database development tool built on MySQL.  Visit
\url{https://project-redcap.org} for more information.  REDCap
provides an API through which data, the data dictionary, files, and

As much as possible, I've tried to adequately document \code{redcapAPI}.
Some topics did not seem well suited to documenting in the typical R
help files.  Additional tips and discussion are available at the
package wiki at
\url{https://github.com/vubiostat/redcapAPI/wiki}.  These topics include
"Getting started with \code{redcapAPI}",
"Setting Rights to Grant API Access", "Export data from REDCap" and a
detailed description of the REDCap API
parameters and how they are implemented in \code{R}.  I expect most
documentation improvements to be placed on
the wiki.

Please refer to your institution's REDCap API documentation as a
primary resource of what is available.
Different versions of REDCap support different features--your REDCap
API documentation will address the
features specific to your version of REDCap.

\code{redcapAPI} wouldn't be possible without the efforts of Jeffrey
Horner, Will Gray, and Jeremy Stephens at
Vanderbilt University. Their work in developing the original \code{redcap}
package.
was invaluable in helping me understand the API.  A few of their functions
(\code{redcapConnection},
\code{fieldToVar}, \code{exportMetaData}, and \code{exportRecords}) are
included in \code{redcapAPI} largely unaltered.

Many thanks also go to Will Beasley of University of Oklahoma for his
development of the \code{REDCapR} package
\url{https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR}.  Will introduced me to the
\code{httr} package--which improved the use
of messages from the API--and to the idea of batching API calls to reduce
the likelihood of servers timing out.

The user should also refer to their institution's REDCap API
documentation as a primary resource of what is available.  Different
versions of REDCap support different features--the user's REDCap
API documentation will address the features specific to their version
of REDCap.
