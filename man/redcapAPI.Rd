\title{Access data, meta data, and files from REDCap using the API}
\description{
REDCap is a database development tool built on MySQL.  Visit
\url{https://project-redcap.org} for more information.  REDCap
provides an API through which data, the data dictionary, files, and
project information can be accessed.  The \code{redcapAPI} package
facilitates the use of these functions and
simplifies the work needed to prepare data for
analysis.
}
\details{
The user should also refer to their institution's REDCap API
documentation as a primary resource of what is available.  Different
versions of REDCap support different features--the user's REDCap
API documentation will address the features specific to their version
of REDCap.
