\arguments{
\item{rcon}{A \code{redcapConnection} object.}

\item{record}{\code{character(1)} or \code{integerish(1)}. The record ID in
which the desired file is stored.}

\item{field}{\code{character(1)}. The field name in which the file is stored.}

\item{event}{\code{character(1)} or \code{NULL}. The event name for the file.
This applies only to longitudinal projects.  If the event is not
supplied for a longitudinal project, the API will return an error message}

\item{repeat_instance}{\code{integerish(1)} or \code{NULL}. The repeat instance number of
the repeating event or the repeating instrument. When available in your
instance of REDCap, and passed as \code{NULL}, the API will assume a value of 1.}

\item{file}{\code{character(1)}. The file path to the file to be imported.}

\item{overwrite}{\code{logical(1)}.  When \code{FALSE}, the function checks
if a file already exists for that record.  If a file exists, the function
terminates to prevent overwriting.  When \code{TRUE}, no additional
check is performed.}

\item{dir}{\code{character(1)}. A directory/folder to which the file
will be saved. By default, the working directory is used.}

\item{file_prefix}{\code{logical(1)}.  Determines if a prefix is appended
to the file name.  The prefix takes the form \verb{[record_id]-[event_name]-[file_name]}.
The file name is always the same name of the file as it exists in REDCap.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to other methods}

\item{error_handling}{\code{character(1)}. One of \code{c("error", "null")}.
An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link[=redcapError]{redcapError()}}.}

\item{config}{A named \code{list}. Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr:POST]{httr::POST()}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{A named \code{list}. Additional API parameters to pass into the
body of the API call. This provides users to execute calls with options
that may not otherwise be supported by \code{redcapAPI}.}
}
\value{
\code{exportFiles} has no return and displays a message with file path to
which the exported file was saved.

\code{importFiles} has no return and displays a message indicating whether
the import was successful.

\code{deleteFiles} has no return and displays a message indicating whether
the file was successfully deleted from the project.
}
\description{
These methods enable to the user to export a file stored
in a project field, import a file, or delete an existing file.
}
\details{
These functions only export, import, or delete a single file.

When exporting, the file cannot be changed; whatever name exists in
REDCap is the name that will be used. The record ID and event name
may be appended as a prefix.
