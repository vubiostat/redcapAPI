\title{Clean Meta Data of UTF Characters}
\usage{
cleanseMetaData(meta_data_file, meta_data_clean, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{meta_data_file}{\code{character(1)} the path to a meta data file
that has been downloaded using the REDCap user interface.}

\item{meta_data_clean}{\code{character(1)} the path of the file to which
the cleaned meta data will be written.}

\item{overwrite}{\code{logical(1)} Permit the new file to overwrite an
existing file.}
}
\description{
There have been isolated cases observed where certain
characters in the data dictionary prevent it from being downloaded
correctly.  In one case, the data dictionary could not be downloaded
at all through the API.  It is suspected that these problematic
characters are a result of copying and pasting text out of word
processing programs.  The problematic characters are not necessarily
visible and their exact location can be difficult to identify.  As
a last resort, \code{cleanseMetaData} can read a meta data file
downloaded through the user interface, purge it of any UTF-8 characters,
and write an alternate data dictionary that contains only ASCII
characters.
