\arguments{
\item{rcon}{a \code{redcapConnection} object.}

\item{folder_id}{\code{integerish} with maximum length 1. the
folder ID of a specific folder in the File Repository for which you
wish to export a list of its files and sub-folders.
By default, the top-level directory of the File Repository will be used.}

\item{recursive}{\code{logical(1)}. When \code{TRUE}, content of subfolders
will be retrieved until a full listing is produced. If \code{FALSE},
only the contents of the requested folder will be returned.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed between methods}

\item{error_handling}{An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link{redcapError}}}

\item{config}{\code{list} Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr]{POST}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{\code{list} Additional API parameters to pass into the
body of the API call. This provides users to execute calls with options
that may not otherwise be supported by \code{redcapAPI}.}
