\arguments{
\item{rcon}{A REDCap connection object as created by \code{redcapConnection}.}

\item{logtype}{\code{character} with maximum length of 1. The log event types to export. By
default, all event types are exported. Must be one of
\code{c("export", "manage", "user", "record", "record_add", "record_edit", "record_delete", "lock_record", "page_view")}}

\item{user}{\code{character} with maximum length of 1. Users for whom to return logs. By default
logs for all users are returned.}

\item{record}{\code{character} with maximum length of 1. Record ID for which logs are to be returned.
By default, logs are returned for all records.}

\item{dag}{\code{character} with maximum length of 1. Data access group ID for which to return logs.
By default, logs are returned for all data access groups.}

\item{beginTime}{\code{POSIXct} with maximum length 1. When given, only
logs recorded after this time will be returned.}

\item{endTime}{\code{POSIXct} with maximum length 1. When given, only logs
recorded before this time will be returned.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed between methods}

\item{error_handling}{An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link{redcapError}}}

\item{config}{\code{list} Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr]{POST}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{\code{list} Additional API parameters to pass into the
body of the API call. This provides users to execute calls with options
that may not otherwise be supported by \code{redcapAPI}.}
