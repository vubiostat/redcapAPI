\description{
This method allows you to export a list of the repeated
instruments and repeating events for a project. This includes
their unique instrument name as seen in the second column of the
Data Dictionary, as well as each repeating instrument's corresponding
custom repeating instrument label. For longitudinal projects, the
unique event name is also returned for each repeating instrument.
Additionally, repeating events are returned as separate items, in
which the instrument name will be blank/null to indicate that it is a
repeating event (rather than a repeating instrument).
