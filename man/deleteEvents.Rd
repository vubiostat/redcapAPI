\description{
This method allows you to delete Events from a project.
Notice: Because of this method's destructive nature, it is only
available for use for projects in Development status. Additionally,
please be aware that deleting an event will automatically delete
any records/data that have been collected under that event
(this is non-reversible data loss).
