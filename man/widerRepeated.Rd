\usage{
widerRepeated(Records, rcon)
}
\arguments{
\item{Records}{A \code{data.frame} containing the records from
\code{\link{exportRecordsTyped}}}

\item{rcon}{A REDCap connection object as created by \code{unlockREDCap}.}
}
\description{
Converts a dataframe into wide format given a single REDCap form.
This function assumes that the Records argument is the result of exportRecordsTyped,
and that all empty values have been previously dropped. This will only widen dataframes
that have a unique identification variable (e.g. 'record_id'), "redcap_event_name" and
"redcap_repeat_instrument" in the fields. Otherwise, the data passed in will be returned
unchanged.
