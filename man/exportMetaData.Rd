\usage{
exportMetaData(rcon, ...)

\method{exportMetaData}{redcapApiConnection}(
  rcon,
  fields = character(0),
  forms = character(0),
  ...,
  drop_utf8 = FALSE,
  error_handling = getOption("redcap_error_handling"),
  config = list(),
  api_param = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rcon}{A REDCap connection object as generated by \code{redcapConnection.}}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to other methods.}

\item{fields}{A character vector of field names for which the metadata is to
be retrieved.}

\item{forms}{A character vector of forms for which the metadata is to be
retrieved. Note that if a form name is given, all of the fields on that form
will be returned, regardless of whether it is included in \code{fields} or
not.  Be careful to use the form names in the second column of the data
dictionary, and not the display names shown on the webpage.}

\item{drop_utf8}{\code{logical(1)}. In some cases, UTF-8 characters can
pose problems for exporting the data dictionary.  Set this to \code{TRUE}
to replace any UTF-8 characters with empty characters.}

\item{error_handling}{An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link{redcapError}}}

\item{config}{\code{list} Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr]{POST}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{\code{list} Additional API parameters to pass into the
body of the API call. This provides users to execute calls with options
that may not otherwise be supported by \code{redcapAPI}.}
