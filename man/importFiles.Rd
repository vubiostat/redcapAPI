\usage{
importFiles(
  rcon,
  file,
  record,
  field,
  event,
  overwrite = TRUE,
  repeat_instance = NULL,
  ...
)

\method{importFiles}{redcapApiConnection}(

  repeat_instance = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{rcon}{A REDCap connection object as generated by \code{redcapConnection}}

\item{file}{Character string giving the file path to the file to be imported.}

\item{record}{The record ID in which the desired file is stored. Must be length 1.}

\item{field}{The field name in which the file is stored. Must be length 1.}

\item{event}{The event name for the file.  Must be length 1.  This applies
only to longitudinal projects.  If the event is not supplied for a
longitudinal project, the API will return an error}

\item{overwrite}{Logical.  When \code{FALSE}, the function checks if a
file already exists for that record.  If a file exists, the function
terminates to prevent overwriting.  When \code{TRUE}, no additional
check is performed.}

\item{repeat_instance}{The repeat instance number of the repeating
event or the repeating instrument. When available in your instance
of REDCap, and passed as NULL, the API will assume a value of 1.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to other methods}

\item{error_handling}{An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link{redcapError}}}

\item{config}{\code{list} Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr]{POST}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{\code{list} Additional API parameters to pass into the
body of the API call. This provides users to execute calls with options
that may not otherwise be supported by \code{redcapAPI}.}
}
\description{
A single file may be attached to a single record.  The
behavior of this function is consistent with the
behavior of the API, which only allows one file to be uploaded at a time
}
\details{
The function may only import a single file
