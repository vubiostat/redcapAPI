\title{Convert REDCap factors between labelled and coded}
\usage{
redcapFactorFlip(v)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A factor exported from REDCap.  The REDCap type may be radio,
dropdown, check, yesno, etc.}
}
\description{
Factors exported from REDCap can be toggled between the coded
and labelled values with the use of the attributes assigned to the
factors during export.
}
\details{
Each factor type variable in REDCap is given the attributes
\code{redcapLabels} and \code{redcapLevels}.  With these attached to the
vector, switching between the coded and labelled values can be done with
ease.  This may be helpful when the coded value has importance,
such as 0/1 for death, or if a yes is worth 6 points (instead of 1).
