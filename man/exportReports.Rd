\arguments{
\item{rcon}{A REDCap connection object as created by \code{redcapConnection}.}

\item{report_id}{Integer.  Gives the report id of the desired report.
This is located on the Report Builder page of the user interface on REDCap.}

\item{factors}{Logical.  Determines if categorical data from the database
is returned as numeric codes or labelled factors.}

\item{labels}{Logical.  Determines if the variable labels are applied to the data frame.}

\item{dates}{Logical. Determines if date variables are converted to POSIXct format during the download.}

\item{drop}{An optional character vector of REDCap variable names to remove from the
dataset; defaults to NULL. E.g., \code{drop=c("date_dmy", "treatment")}
It is OK for drop to contain variables not present; these names are ignored.}

\item{checkboxLabels}{Logical. Determines the format of labels in checkbox
variables.  If \code{FALSE} labels are applies as "Unchecked"/"Checked".
If \code{TRUE}, they are applied as ""/"\link{field_labe}" where \link{field_label}
is the label assigned to the level in the data dictionary. This option
is only available after REDCap version 6.0.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed between methods.}

\item{error_handling}{An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link{redcapError}}}

\item{config}{\code{list} Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr]{POST}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{\code{list} Additional API parameters to pass into the

\description{
Exports reports from a REDCap Database and formats data if requested
}
\details{
A record of exports through the API is recorded in the Logging section of
the project.

Reports are exported based on their id number, which can be looked up in
the Reports page of a project

\section{REDCap API Documentation (6.5.0)}{

This function allows you to export the data set of a report created on a project's
"Data Exports, Reports, and Stats" page.

Note about export rights (6.0.0+): Please be aware that Data Export user rights will be
applied to this API request. For example, if you have "No Access" data export rights
in the project, then the API report export will fail and return an error. And if you
have "De-Identified" or "Remove all tagged Identifier fields" data export rights,
then some data fields \emph{might} be removed and filtered out of the data set returned
from the API. To make sure that no data is unnecessarily filtered out of your API
request, you should have "Full Data Set" export rights in the project.
