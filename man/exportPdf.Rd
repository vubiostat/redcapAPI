\arguments{
\item{rcon}{A REDCap connection object as generated by \code{redcapConnection}.}

\item{dir}{The directory into which the file should be saved.}

\item{filename}{\code{character(1)}. The base of the file name.  If
\code{record = NULL}, it will be appended with \code{"_blank.pdf"}.  If
\code{record} has a value, it will be appended with \code{"_record_[record id].pdf"}}

\item{record}{The record id for which forms should be downloaded.  May only
have length 1. May be either \code{character} or \code{numeric}.}

\item{events}{The events for which forms should be downloaded}

\item{instruments}{The instruments for which forms should be downloaded}

\item{all_records}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} forms for all records are downloaded.
When \code{TRUE}, this overrides the \code{records} argument.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to other methods.}

\item{error_handling}{An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link{redcapError}}}

\item{config}{\code{list} Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr]{POST}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{\code{list} Additional API parameters to pass into the
body of the API call. This provides users to execute calls with options
that may not otherwise be supported by \code{redcapAPI}.}

\value{
Creates a PDF file that is saved to the directory specified by the user.

\description{
This function allows you to download PDF files of data collection
instruments.  The download may be with or without collected data, and may
return a single record, multiple records, or all records.
}
\details{
This function mimics the behavior of "Download PDF of Instruments" button on the
REDCap user interface.
}
\section{REDCap API Documentation}{

This function allows you to export a PDF file for any of the following: 1) a
single data collection instrument (blank), 2) all instruments (blank), 3) a
single instrument (with data from a single record), 4) all instruments (with
data from a single record), or 5) all instruments (with data from ALL records).
This is the exact same PDF file that is downloadable from a project's data entry
form in the web interface, and additionally, the user's privileges with regard to
data exports will be applied here just like they are when downloading the PDF in
the web interface (e.g., if they have de-identified data export rights, then it
will remove data from certain fields in the PDF). If the user has "No Access" data
export rights, they will not be able to use this method, and an error will be returned.
