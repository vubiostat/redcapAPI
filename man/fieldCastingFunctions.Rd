\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} with the data fields to be recoded.}

\item{rcon}{\code{recapConnection} object.}

\item{fields}{\code{character/logical/integerish}. A vector for identifying
which fields to recode. When \code{logical}, the length must match
the number of columns in \code{data} (i.e., recycling not permitted).
A message is printed if any of the indicated fields are not a
multiple choice field; no action will be taken on such fields.
For this function, yes/no and true/false fields are considered
multiple choice fields. Fields of class \code{mChoice} are quietly skipped.}

\item{cast}{A named \code{list} of user specified class casting functions.
Keys must correspond to a truncated REDCap field type, i.e.
{date_, datetime_, datetime_seconds_, time_mm_ss, time_hh_mm_ss, time, float,
number, calc, int, integer, select, radio, dropdown, yesno, truefalse,
checkbox, form_complete, sql}. The function will be
provided the variables (x, field_name, coding).
See \code{\link{fieldValidationAndCasting}}}

\item{suffix}{\code{character(1)}. An optional suffix to provide if
the recoded variables should be returned as new columns. For example,
if recoding a field \code{forklift_brand} and \code{suffix = "_labelled"},
the result will have one column with the coded values
(\code{forklift_brand}) and one column with the labelled values
(\code{forklift_brand_labelled}).}

\item{na}{A named \code{list} of user specified functions to determine if the
data is NA. This is useful when data is loaded that has coding for NA, e.g.
-5 is NA. Keys must correspond to a truncated REDCap field type, i.e.
{date_, datetime_, datetime_seconds_, time_mm_ss, time_hh_mm_ss, time, float,
number, calc, int, integer, select, radio, dropdown, yesno, truefalse,
checkbox, form_complete, sql}. The function will be provided the variables
(x, field_name, coding). The function must return a vector of logicals
matching the input. It defaults to \code{\link{isNAorBlank}} for all
entries.}

\item{validation}{A named \code{list} of user specified validation functions. The
same named keys are supported as the na argument. The function will be
provided the variables (x, field_name, coding). The function must return a
vector of logical matching the input length. Helper functions to construct
these are \code{\link{valRx}} and \code{\link{valChoice}}. Only fields that
are not identified as NA will be passed to validation functions.}

\item{quiet}{Print no messages if triggered, Default=FALSE.}

\item{threshold}{numeric(1). The threshold of non-NA data to trigger casting.}

\item{style}{character. One of "labelled" or "coded". Default is "labelled"}

\item{drop_fields}{logical(1). Drop fields that were aggregated.}

\description{
The functions provided here allow for recasting fields
after records have been exported. They generally have a similar
interface to the casting strategy of \code{\link{exportRecordsTyped}},
though they may not each offer all the same options.
}
\details{
\code{recastRecords} is a post-processing function motivated
initially by the need to switch between codes and labels in multiple
choice fields. Field types for which no casting function is specified will
be returned with no changes. It will not attempt to validate the content
of fields; fields that can not be successfully cast will be quietly
returned as missing values.

\code{castForImport} is written with defaults that will return data
in a format ready to be imported to a project via \code{importRecords}.
All fields are returned as character vectors. If any values fail to
validation check, are report is returned as an attribute named \code{invalid}.
These are then set to \code{NA}, which will be imported as blanks through
the API.

\code{guessCast} is a helper function to make a guess at casting uncast
columns. It will do a type cast if a validation is met above
a threshold ratio of non-NA records. It modifies the existing
\code{invalid} attribute to reflect the cast. \code{guessDate} is
a special cast of \code{guessCast} that has defaults set for casting
a date field.

\code{mChoiceCast} is a helper function that adds the \code{Hmisc::mChoice}
multiple choice class. It adds a column for a multiple choice checkbox
that is cast to the \code{Hmisc::mChoice} class. Requires \code{Hmisc}
to be loaded.
