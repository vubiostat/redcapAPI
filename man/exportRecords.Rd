\arguments{
\item{rcon}{A REDCap connection object as created by \code{redcapConnection}.}

\item{factors}{Logical.  Determines if categorical data from the database is
returned as numeric codes or labelled factors. See 'Checkbox Variables'
for more on how this interacts with the \code{checkboxLabels} argument.}

\item{fields}{A character vector of fields to be returned.  If \code{NULL},
all fields are returned.}

\item{forms}{A character vector of forms to be returned.  If \code{NULL},
all forms are returned.}

\item{records}{A vector of study id's to be returned.  If \code{NULL}, all
subjects are returned.}

\item{events}{A character vector of events to be returned from a
longitudinal database.  If \code{NULL}, all events are returned.}

\item{labels}{Logical.  Determines if the variable labels are applied to
the data frame.}

\item{dates}{Logical. Determines if date variables are converted to POSIXct
format during the download.}

\item{drop}{An optional character vector of REDCap variable names to remove from the
dataset; defaults to NULL. E.g., \code{drop=c("date_dmy", "treatment")}
It is OK for drop to contain variables not present; these names are ignored.}

\item{survey}{specifies whether or not to export the survey identifier field
(e.g., "redcap_survey_identifier") or survey timestamp fields
(e.g., form_name+"_timestamp") when surveys are utilized in the project.
If you do not pass in this flag, it will default to "true". If set to
"true", it will return the redcap_survey_identifier field and also the
survey timestamp field for a particular survey when at least
one field from that survey is being exported. NOTE: If the survey
identifier field or survey timestamp fields are imported via API data
import, they will simply be ignored since they are not real fields in
the project but rather are pseudo-fields.}

\item{dag}{specifies whether or not to export the "redcap_data_access_group"
field when data access groups are utilized in the project. If you do not
pass in this flag, it will default to "false". NOTE: This flag is only
viable if the user whose token is being used to make the API request is
\emph{not} in a data access group. If the user is in a group, then this
flag will revert to its default value.}

\item{checkboxLabels}{Logical. Determines the format of labels in checkbox
variables.  If \code{FALSE} labels are applies as "Unchecked"/"Checked".
If \code{TRUE}, they are applied as ""/"\link{field_label}" where \link{field_label}
is the label assigned to the level in the data dictionary.
This option is only available after REDCap version 6.0.  See Checkbox Variables
for more on how this interacts with the \code{factors} argument.}

\item{colClasses}{A (named) vector of column classes passed to
\code{\link[utils]{read.csv}} calls.
Useful to force the interpretation of a column in a specific type and
avoid an unexpected recast.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed between methods.}

\item{batch.size}{Integer.  Specifies the number of subjects to be included
in each batch of a batched export.  Non-positive numbers export the
entire project in a single batch. Batching the export may be beneficial
to prevent tying up smaller servers.  See details for more explanation.}

\item{error_handling}{An option for how to handle errors returned by the API.
see \code{\link{redcapError}}}

\item{config}{\code{list} Additional configuration parameters to pass to
\code{\link[httr]{POST}}. These are appended to any parameters in
\code{rcon$config}.}

\item{api_param}{\code{list} Additional API parameters to pass into the
body of the API call. This provides users to execute calls with options
that may not otherwise be supported by \code{redcapAPI}.}

\item{form_complete_auto}{\code{logical(1)}. When \code{TRUE}
(default), the \code{[form]_complete} fields for any form
from which at least one variable is requested will automatically
be retrieved.  When \code{FALSE}, these fields must be
explicitly requested.}

\item{dataFile}{For the offline version, a character string giving the location
of the dataset downloaded from REDCap.  Note that this should be the raw
(unlabeled) data set.}

\item{metaDataFile}{A text string giving the location of the data dictionary
downloaded from REDCap.}

\item{meta_data}{Deprecated version of \code{metaDataFile}}
}
\description{
Exports records from a REDCap Database, allowing for
subsets of subjects, fields, records, and events.
}
\details{
A record of exports through the API is recorded in the Logging section
of the project.

The 'offline' version of the function operates on the raw (unlabeled) data
file downloaded from REDCap along with the data dictionary.
This is made available for instances where the API can not be accessed for
some reason (such as waiting for API approval from the REDCap administrator).

It is unnecessary to include "redcap_event_name" in the fields argument.
This field is automatically exported for any longitudinal database.
If the user does include it in the fields argument, it is removed quietly
in the parameter checks.

A 'batched' export is one where the export is performed over a series of
API calls rather than one large call.  For large projects on small servers,
this may prevent a single user from tying up the server and forcing others
to wait on a larger job.  The batched export is performed by first
calling the API to export the subject identifier field (the first field
in the meta data).  The unique ID's are then assigned a batch number with
no more than \code{batch.size} ID's in any single batch.  The batches are
exported from the API and stacked together.

In longitudinal projects, \code{batch.size} may not necessarily be the
number of records exported in each batch.  If \code{batch.size} is 10 and
there are four records per patient, each batch will consist of 40 records.
Thus, if you are concerned about tying up the server with a large,
longitudinal project, it would be prudent to use a smaller batch size.

\section{Checkbox Variables}{


There are four ways the data from checkbox variables may be
represented depending on the values of \code{factors} and
\code{checkboxLabels}. The most common are the first and third
rows of the table below.  When \code{checkboxLabels = TRUE}, either
the coded value or the labelled value is returned if the box is
checked, or an empty string if it is not.

\tabular{lll}{
\code{factors} \tab \code{checkboxLabels} \tab Output \cr
\code{FALSE}   \tab \code{FALSE}          \tab 0 / 1 \cr
\code{FALSE}   \tab \code{TRUE}           \tab "" / value \cr
\code{TRUE}    \tab \code{FALSE}          \tab Unchecked / Checked \cr
\code{TRUE}    \tab \code{TRUE}           \tab "" / label
}
}

\section{REDCap API Documentation (6.5.0)}{

This function allows you to export a set of records for a project

Note about export rights (6.0.0+): Please be aware that Data Export user rights will be
applied to this API request. For example, if you have "No Access" data export rights
in the project, then the API data export will fail and return an error. And if you
have "De-Identified" or "Remove all tagged Identifier fields" data export rights,
then some data fields \emph{might} be removed and filtered out of the data set returned
from the API. To make sure that no data is unnecessarily filtered out of your API
request, you should have "Full Data Set" export rights in the project.

\section{Deidentified Batched Calls}{

Batched calls to the API are not a feature of the REDCap API, but may be imposed
by making multiple calls to the API.  The process of batching the export requires
that an initial call be made to the API to retrieve only the record IDs.  The
list of IDs is then broken into chunks, each about the size of \code{batch.size}.
The batched calls then force the \code{records} argument in each call.

When a user's permissions require a de-identified data export, a batched call
should be expected to fail.  This is because, upon export, REDCap will hash the
identifiers.  When R attempts to pass the hashed identifiers back to REDCap,
REDCap will try to match the hashed identifiers to the unhashed identifiers in the
database.  No matches will be found, and the export will fail.

Users who are exporting de-identified data will have to settle for using unbatched
calls to the API (ie, \code{batch.size = -1})
